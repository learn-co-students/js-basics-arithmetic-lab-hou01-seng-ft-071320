// Write your code here
// Create a variable called multiply that will multiply var1 and var2 whose results will equal "62".
// Create a variable called random that will generate a random integer greater than 0.
// Create a variable called mod set to an equation whose remainder is equal to "4".
// Create a variable called max that will return "20" as the highest number in the set.

let var1 = 2
let var2 = 31
let multiply = var1 * var2 

let random = Math.floor(Math.random * 10) + 1

let mod = 16/4

let max = Math.max(1,20)
